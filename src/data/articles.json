I am the chief editor here at _Studium._ Given my role, one might expect I decide which topics to cover in our publications. However, that is not how we operate. An algorithm chooses what articles _Studium_ writes. This algorithm is a computer program. It works by collecting copious amounts of data about people who visit _Studium\u2019s_ website. Then, it processes the data to find out things like trends in the cultural ethos, the probability of an article becoming popular, and even the demographic most expected to click on a headline. The algorithm supplies us with story ideas, and then we turn the robot\u2019s machinations into full, flushed out, and researched pieces of writing. In other words: computers know what humans will consume by invading their privacy.\r\n\r\nIt is not just _Studium_ that uses A.I. to gain insights about its audience. Almost every website tracks its users. These pages gather information and feed it to an algorithm that spits out results about the people who visit the site. Information like their age, gender, interests, sexual orientation, friends, and even who they texted last, can all be discovered easily (Hanif, 2018). Internet users tend to think of themselves as anonymous, merely little blips of network traffic, which ping themselves between different domains. Ten, maybe even five, years ago this was the case. Now, the last thing anyone has is anonymity.\r\n\r\nIn a modern age where privacy is a fleeting right, and data sells like hotcakes, people often wonder if privacy was ever necessary. If it is not evident already, I disagree with this stance; privacy is invaluable and a cornerstone of freedom. Despite my current view, I was once unbothered by the invasion of my personal information. It was not until I studied philosophy that the need for confidentiality became clear. Philosophers throughout the ages grappled with the importance of privacy, such as **Aristotle**, who described the public and private spheres of life. The former being for family and interpersonal relationships, and the ladder for external affairs, like politics. According to him, the private sphere was a prerequisite for a working partisan system. Later, **John Locke** touched on the issue as well, in his work the _Second Treatise on Government,_ when he discussed the importance of citizens owning their land. Locke argued that owing land empowered members of a society to have their own space, creating a \u201Czone of exclusivity,\u201D wherein individuals were free to do as they pleased. Both Locke and Aristotle viewed privacy as a requirement for a well-functioning civilization.\r\n\r\n<img height=\"auto\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b8\/John_Locke.jpg\"><\/img>\r\n_John Locke, one of the most studied philosophers_\r\n\r\nIf philosophers were deliberating on it since the beginning of the modern era, there must be intrinsic value to a particular form of secrecy in our lives. It was Locke, Aristotle, and other philosophers that changed my laisse fair attitude toward my personal information. Thus, this issue will highlight philosophical ideations on privacy, and hopefully, the reader will value their right to it more as a result.",

            "bodyText": "To control its populous with ever more strict tactics, China has recently employed the use of facial recognition technology to track its citizens. Cameras in locations like train stations, hotel lobbies, and restaurants continually identify and log members of the public. If the government wants to know where a target was a week ago, they can retrieve the person\u2019s last known whereabouts by scanning a database. Facial recognition helps authoritarian regimes oppress activists or anyone who poses a threat to their power by allowing them to be located and quickly jailed. In protest of the government\u2019s use of recognition technology, Chinese activists have set up an art exhibition to explore the ramifications of losing public anonymity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/content.fortune.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/cam11_a-copy.jpg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><\/img>\r\n_Facial recognition software is able to ID members of a crowd_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exhibit, titled _Eyes of the City_, features 60 unique instillations, all centered around the theme of facial recognition software. The Futian train station of Shenzhen is the home of the gallery. The visionaries of the project \u2013 Carlo Ratti, Michele Bonino, and Sun Yimin \u2013 decided on a train station for its unique symbolism as a place of individual obscurity. The crowd hides citizens at Futian, concealing them with thousands of passers-by. However, the government\u2019s new surveillance tactics actively destroy this public privacy, where cameras will soon identify each person in a crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/static.dezeen.com\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Shenzhen_dezeen_2364_col_9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><\/img>\r\n_The transformed Futian train station_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes the art show unique is its focus on the aesthetics of surveillance. One exhibit, entitled _Image in Place,_ examines the beauty of the macro view of a city. When hundreds of aerial photographs are stitched together into one large birds-eye-view Shenzhen, the viewer feels omnipotent, powerful, and elated by the complete visual knowledge of a location. Thus, the piece posits that large-scale knowledge of a locality or populace gives its possessor tremendous authority, much as the Chinese government has.\r\n\r\n_Image in Place_ is particularly relevant to **David Hume\u2019s** outlook on beauty. Making something disturbing, the mass privacy invasion of the public, into something beautiful, has to do with the subjectivity of art. As Hume said, beauty is, \u201Cno quality in things themselves, it exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.\u201D In other words, there is no one idea or object which is universally attractive to people; rather, it is their perception, which makes something aesthetically pleasing. In the same sense, surveillance is repugnant and menacing to the populous of China, but a thing of beauty and necessity for their rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http:\/\/eyesofthecity.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/01-1.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><\/img>\r\n_One picture from Eyes of the City_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjectivity of attractiveness is a long-contemplated idea in the aesthetics branch of philosophy. Hume speculated that what is aesthetically pleasing is entirely dependent on the viewer. This outlook explains why two people can look at the same thing and disagree on its prettiness, for example, a painting. The typical disagreement on aesthetics between individuals can extend to a larger world view. An aesthetic difference in opinion is what the _Eyes of the City_ exhibitions illustrate with high effectiveness. Some spectators may find comfort, and ultimate beauty, in facial recognition technology. For instance, surveillance may subdue terrorism. However, others could be incredibly scared by the theft of their public anonymity.",

            "bodyText": "Six complaints from Canadian's whose devices were searched, without reasonable grounds, were found to be valid by an independent oversight committee. According to the grievances, officers disregarded several regulations when performing personal device searches, most notable of which, the requirement that they only investigate local content on the device. The law provides border patrol the right to carry out phone searches when they have reasonable ground to do so, provided that off-device data, such as social media accounts, are not inspected. The officers ignored this requirement, and instead, performed an invasive examination without reasonable grounds on several occasions.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/images.thestar.com\/5rB2McxFvtgrDXDpyMY7k28y_mI=\/1086x725\/smart\/filters:cb(2700061000)\/https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/content\/dam\/thestar\/news\/canada\/2010\/04\/22\/are_our_customs_officers_traumatizing_visitors\/canadianborderjpg.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><\/img>\r\n_The canadian border vehicle inspection station_ \r\n\r\nBorder patrol's role is to keep the Canadian population safe from domestic threats, such as terrorism. Their job entails questioning travelers, inspecting luggage, and in some cases, investigations of personal belongings. It seems reasonable that officers be allowed to examine baggage, as dangerous items may be present within them. This agreement between border patrol \u2013 also, more generally, governmental authority \u2013 and citizens is called a **social contract**. Members of society agree to give up certain personal rights (in this instance, the right to privacy) to protect the entire populous. **Thomas Hobbes**, a prolific English philosopher in the field of ethics, wrote extensively on the ideas surrounding state protections. According to him, life in the state of nature, meaning without societal protections was, \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" Consequently, people avoid the state of nature by assembling a civilization wherein they feel more secure, and ultimately, safe.\r\n\r\n> ``\"The life of man in the state of nature, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\"``\r\n\r\nSo, one view is that border patrol is harmlessly filing out their part of the social contract. The tourists give up part of their right to privacy by allowing phone searches in exchange for the state's protection. Well, this works, but only to a certain extent. As the complaints allege, border patrol conducted a digital device investigation without a justifiable warrant. Thus, the government is violating the social contract. The agreement between the authority and the public is that  rights are given up only to the necessary extent. For example, individuals give up the right to steal other's possessions, and in exchange, their goods are not purloined. However, when the confiscation of freedoms by the state starts to cross into an excessive territory, authoritarian regimes develop. When governments seize fundamental liberties to maintain control, the state of nature can quickly redevelop.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/nationalinterest.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/desktop__1260_\/public\/main_images\/RTX6LWAZ%20%281%29.jpg?itok=dSzvnwHr\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><\/img>\r\n_North Korea is an example of a dictatorial regime_\r\n\r\nIn the case of the border patrol agents, they were violating the traveler's right to privacy in a way that did not benefit the overall safety of the nation. Instead, the agents were exercising their power over others for their enjoyment. In the modern age, citizens must pay attention to violations of their privacy. Rampant data collection, like that performed by the NSA, also violates the social contract. If governments overstep their power, citizens may have to give up fundamental rights, which is anything but beneficial to their safety.",

            "bodyText": "It was a distressing task, and even if it went perfectly well, it would change his life forever. Edward Snowden, at the time a 29-year-old former NSA employee, had to decide whether to leak government documents highlighting incredibly invasive civil surveillance practices. If he exposed the top-secret information, it would most definitely lead to legal prosecution; if he did not, the privacy of millions worldwide would continue to be unduly violated. Snowden decided to give the documents to the press. From that moment on, he was forced into exile, hiding away in Russia. When asked why he sacrificed his livelihood to expose the NSA\u2019s corruption, Snowden responded by saying, \u201CIf we sacrifice our values because we\u2019re afraid, we don\u2019t care about [our] values very much.\u201D \r\n\r\n> \u201CIf we sacrifice our values because we\u2019re afraid, we don\u2019t care about our values very much.\u201D \r\n\r\nThe mantra of those who \u201Cblow the whistle\u201D on misconduct (this analogy is why they are called whistleblowers) is akin to Snowden\u2019s. Leaking private information, from the government or otherwise, can end an entire career, lead to personal harm, or imprisonment. Despite the danger, whistleblowers continue to come forward. In cases like Snowden\u2019s, the act is noble and necessary, but whistleblowing is an ethically complex deed. Disclosing top-secret intelligence can put others in peril. Therefore, exposing private documents and practices to the world is a profoundly philosophical act, based on one\u2019s moral framework.\r\n\r\n### Edward Snowden\r\nWhile working as a contractor for the NSA, Snowden was deeply troubled by two of their surveillance programs. The first was codenamed Prism and was a division of the government focused on civil spying. Numerous \u201Cpartnerships\u201D with tech conglomerates like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, allowed the NSA to gather information at will from a vast swath of the U.S. populous. Social communication companies were and still are, required to monitor communications for words commonly associated with terrorism (an example being \u201Cbomb\u201D) and report to this data to the Prism programme. However, the government did not limit its data collection just to threats of domestic terrorism; it also collected private conversations that seemingly have no relation to extremist groups. \r\n\r\nThe second programme was the NSA\u2019s tapping of all fiberoptic cabling running through the country, to monitor foreign communications. Altogether, the U.S. was collecting terabytes of secretive data every hour. The pile of information continues to grow to this day, and with increased internet usage worldwide, the scope of the assemblage has too.\r\n\r\nThere is no question as to how dangerous mass surveillance is. When the right to privacy is lost, it is impossible to have a functioning democracy. As Daniel Therrien, the privacy commissioner of Canada, puts it: \u201Cprivacy is nothing less than a prerequisite for freedom.\u201D For example, if the government were able to deduce which political figure a citizen is likely to vote for, perhaps with the aid of swaths of personal information, targeted ads convincing them otherwise could be run. With a system like this in place, leaders stay in power for unjust amounts of time. In more extreme cases, such as North Korea, civil spying is used to murder political opponents. Therefore, Snowden\u2019s fear of this technology is justifiable.\r\n\r\n> \u201CPrivacy is nothing less than a prerequisite for freedom.\u201D \r\n\r\nFaced with inevitable legal consequences for doing so, Snowden ultimately decided to leak documents proving the existence and scope of the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance programs. The government was quick to denounce him for being a traitor. The NSA argued that Snowden\u2019s whistleblowing was unethical, whereas his supporters backed it as a heroic deed. Despite the claims of U.S. leaders, leaking the classified documents, in an ironic twist, has led to the public\u2019s greater awareness of the betrayal of their data. Thus, Snowden\u2019s disclosure of records was an **altruistic** act. In the branch of philosophy called **ethics,** which concerns how people should behave, an altruistic choice does not benefit one\u2019s self, but others instead. French philosopher **Auguste Comte** coined the term. He believed that the morally correct action was the one that maximized positive consequences for those who were not the actor. For Snowden, leaking classified files to the press effectively exiled him from the United States, his home country. However, the action leads to beneficial results for the citizens of America.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.britannica.com\/78\/23678-050-1DCF79A2\/Auguste-Comte-Tony-Toullion-Bibliotheque-Nationale-Paris.jpg\" height=\"auto\" width=\"100%\"><\/img>\r\n_Auguste Comte in a 19th century drawing by Tony Toullion_\r\n\r\nIf Snowden\u2019s choice aligns with Comte\u2019s altruism, then the NSA\u2019s actions are akin to **Epicurus\u2019s epicureanism**, an ancient form of, and thought to be the predecessor to modern-day **hedonism.** Hedonism, and by extension, epicureanism, is the belief that maximizing the value of one\u2019s pleasure and overall lifestyle is the correct way to act. In the case of the government, mass surveillance maximized its power over citizens. Those in powerful positions gain more wealth and security when they increase control. Thus, by putting in place the Prism and international monitoring programmes, the United States carried out a hedonist action. Modern-day **consequentialist** philosophers often criticize hedonism as immoral, since it can lead to the suffering of others at the expense of an individual\u2019s pleasure. Consequentialism, initially introduced by **Kant** in his **second maxim**, implores people to \u201Ctreat human beings as an end within themselves, not a means to an end.\u201D In other words, the use of others for hedonistic gain is ethically incorrect. The NSA\u2019s exploit of citizen\u2019s data to gain power is an example of treating the populace as a means to an end.\r\n\r\nDefenders of mass surveillance often argue that it is a necessary evil. Preventing domestic terrorism requires that citizens sacrifice some privacy. This idea harks back to **Hobbes\u2019s Social Contract**, the notion that individuals in society give up liberties to protect the whole civilisation (more detail can be found [here](www.google.com)). However, this contract can only be pushed so far until the state becomes totalitarian, taking away _all_ civil liberty in pursuit of power. **John Locke** recognized the flaw in Hobbes\u2019s idea, and revised it in his own work to include the ability for a population to overthrow its rulers. A possible rebellion enables a two-way power dynamic, wherein the ruling class is dependent on the approval of the everyman. Therefore, by exposing the presiding leader\u2019s violation of the social contract, Snowden allows the citizens to decide whether they continue to accept the defilement of their privacy.\r\n\r\nSnowden committed a courageous, altruistic act, inspired by such ideas as consequentialism. He stood up to authority in defence of his values. In doing so, he revealed the incredible violation of privacy by the NSA, who in turn, decided to pursue Snowden with all legal authority they had. Other whistleblowers have faced the same fate. It becomes a testament to the moral fortitude of whistleblowers, that even staring down their own demise, they are willing to sacrifice themselves for the betterment of others.",

            "bodyText": "There is a long-standing dilemma in philosophy when it comes to personal identity. The question is, essentially, \u201Cwhat makes someone who they are?\u201D Many great thinkers have attempted to answer this dilemma. **Heraclitus**, an ancient Greek philosopher, proposed that, since everything is in constant change, there can be no notion of a nonfluctuating self. However, others like **John Locke** argued that the identity of a person is the identity of consciousness, or more simply put; an individual is the accumulation of their memories. Both Heraclitus and Locke\u2019s theories are complex and take many hours of contemplation to understand.\r\n\r\n> \"What makes someone who they are?\"\r\n\r\nIn contrast, one of the most straightforward ideas of the self is the **Body Theory**, which states that a human is merely their physical self. It only takes a little critical thinking to discredit this idea. For example, our body replaces the entirety of its cells (minus those in the brain) every seven to ten years. Therefore, we effectively have a new person every decade, so according to the Body Theory, we are a completely new individual. Despite its apparent flaws, the Body Theory is gaining new relevance in the age of digital surveillance.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1501869150797-9bbb64f782fd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1534&q=80\" height=\"auto\" width=\"100%\"><\/img>\r\n_The Body Theory of personal identity states that our entire \"self\" is our physical being_\r\n\r\nA common tactic in surveillance is the use of security cameras and facial recognition software. Computers are fed footage from public places, then identify faces that match a pre-existing database. Cops use information form the software to catch criminals fleeing the scene of a crime, or fugitives who have gone undercover. The problem with facial recognition is that mismatches are quite common. This spying method fundamentally entrusts the Body Theory to identify and individual. Thus, if two people look alike, a false positive can quickly occur. When an erroneous detection happens, it can falsely jail suspects solely for looking like a murderer who could have been nearby. A real-world example of this occurred when Amara Majeed, a Brown University student, was falsely accused as a suspect in the Easter Sri Lankan church bombings.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/F4F4K27OKFDHNNU2C4EQC4LRZI.jpg&w=767\" height=\"auto\" width=\"100%\"><\/img>\r\n_Amara Majeed speaking to reporters about her experience being wrongly implicated in the mass bombing_\r\n\r\nMany issues plague the technique of facial recognition. Identical twins produce a false flag, as well as similar facial hair or clothing. The main issue stems from the fact the body is not a reliable marker of identity. Problems with the Body Theory also apply to face recognition, the main one being that altering one\u2019s self is easy. Criminals could frame innocent people by making cosmetic changes to match their appearance, or similarly, evade detection by reimagining their \u201Clook\u201D after a crime. Thus, a person\u2019s physical presence is not enough to identify them. A holistic look is needed instead. It is for this reason that detectives investigate suspects extensively before making any claims. As a result, agents utilize Locke\u2019s ideas about the identity of consciousness to arrest people, not just their bodies. By calling in witnesses, looking at forensic evidence, and questioning suspects, detectives convict based on an individual\u2019s appearance as well as genuine identity.\r\n\r\n> \"A person\u2019s physical presence is not enough to identify them\"\r\n\r\nFacial recognition software, when used ethically, is a useful tool for both police and the justice system. However, it cannot be the only instrument when it comes to finding suspects, as it is prone to error. Heraclitus, Locke, and many other philosophers have long agreed that the body is not the correct way to attribute identity to a person. Therefore, modern technological solutions should adopt a comprehensive approach - including the use of forensic data plus questioning - that prevents mistakes when trying to bring criminals to justice.",

To understand what being in a relationship across realities means, the reader must first understand Modal Realism. Respected philosopher **David Lewis** argues anything logically possible exists in a different universe from ours. These metaphysical realities, termed by him as Worlds, are infinite in number. For example, in one World, dogs may be called cats, and cats called dogs. Since it is logically possible to imagine, modal realists argue that the dog-cat mix-up exists in another World. Possible realities are entirely separated from one another, both by space and time, as well as causally \u2013 meaning anything that happens in one world cannot influence anything which occurs in another. Due to the nature of the theory, modal realism cannot be proven or disproven. Despite its uncertainty, it has proven useful in analyzing concepts like possibility and certitude; something is possible only if it can exist in another reality, whereas something is true if it can exist in all realities.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.britannica.com\/18\/99818-004-4F6B91F4\/David-Kellogg-Lewis.jpg\" height=\"auto\" width=\"100%\"><\/img>\r\n_David Lewis, creator of Modal Realism._\r\n\r\nSinhababu extrapolates a method for obtaining his perfect girlfriend using modal realities. If there are infinite possible universes, surely there is one wherein a girl pines for a man exactly like him. Furthermore, he can pick the _perfect_ woman for himself because there are _infinitely many_ options. Not only will his trans-world girlfriend be a match made in heaven, but she will also desire a man precisely like Sinhababu. The first and most glaring issue that arises with relationships across non-temporally, or causally, linked Worlds is that the lovers can never meet. However, it may be helpful for a particularly lonely philosopher to at least know there is a girl yearning for him, loving him completely, despite her imprisonment within a different universe.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1438354694054-86e6ba9d046b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1567&q=80\" height=\"auto\" width=\"100%\"><\/img>\r\n_Sinhababu's trans-world girlfriend is trapped in a reality not spatially, temporally, or casually linked to ours._\r\n\r\nThe second issue that Sinhababu must face when picking his otherworldly girlfriend is the infinite copies of himself. Since there are endless possible realities, it may be the case that his perfect girlfriend desires a version of himself in another World. To combat this, he devised a system that ensures his girlfriend will pick him, and only him. What he and any other modal realist must do, is make sure they choose a girl who wants the specific universe they live in, down to the subatomic particle. Thus, no self-copies can court her.\r\n\r\nAt a surface level, the value of this philosophic contemplation seems dubious at best. Modal realism lacks any concrete proof, and the girlfriends it provides can only ever exist in thought. However, there is value to any philosophical idea. As **Bertrand Russell** argues, thinking about the universe allows one to expand their mind. By concerning ourselves with the nature of reality, and all the absurd or exciting possibilities it holds, we become less narcissistic. Deep thinking transforms us into \u201Cchildren of the universe,\u201D who are no longer concerned with petty divisions such as borders, but instead, see the unity of everything. People must account for the goods of the mind, in addition to those of the body. One such good is the allowance for the dreaming up of absurd theories. Hence, even though her existence may be far-fetched, a trans-world partner could bring many lonely philosophers some comfort, at least until they find a real one.",

            "bodyText": ">Dear _Studium,_ I was reading your previous issue on Artificial Intelligence, and I had a disturbing thought. As A.I. grows smarter, humans may begin to develop serious relationships with machines. It could get to the point where people entrust software with their deepest, darkest secrets, or depend on it for emotional guidance. I do see the benefit to this, as many individuals have trouble socializing and could use a friend. However, how can we be sure that even the most advanced intelligent robots are genuinely thinking? If we, as humans, are to become bonded to computers, I would hope they become bonded back to us in an honest way.\r\n\r\n_Sincerely, Elisha._ \r\n\r\n<br><\/br>\r\n\r\nThanks for your letter, Elisha. The question you raised here is profound. There are several perspectives regarding the capacity for thought in a non-human intelligence, but I will focus on a classic: **John Searle\u2019s** _Chinese Room_. The thought experiment stipulates that a non-Chinese speaker could know nothing of the language, but still trick others into thinking they are fluent. To understand how, imagine that an English-speaking person is locked up in a room. They are passed Chinese sentences and required to answer by slipping a piece of paper under the door. The captive follows a set of rules about how to put together a sentence; they never devise an answer of their own.\r\n\r\nThe _Chinese Room_ was used by Searle to discredit the Turing test of intelligence. Turing claimed a machine to be intelligent if it was able to produce human-like dialogues. Clearly, given Searle\u2019s thought experiment, this methodology no longer works. Now, as for your question, what the _Chinese Room_ tells is that A.I. could be indistinguishable from a human, but not honestly think. Therefore, a future like the one you imagined is possible, wherein robots are treated as emotionally capable when they only simulate feelings. Researchers in the field of A.I. need to consider the ethical implications of emotional emulation, and they should start with the exact worry you have.",

You are correct in saying that it is impossible to verify that we are real in exactly the way we perceive. However, through a few logical steps, a certainty of our existence can be achieved. **Rene Descartes** constructed a method to certify one\u2019s consciousness in the face of radical doubt. As he described, radical doubt is the mind set in which an individual drops all presuppositions about the nature of their existence, such as information gleamed from their senses. Despite no longer believing in anything he could see, taste, touch, or smell, Descartes devised a way to confirm his actuality.\r\n\r\n_Cogito Ergo Sum_ translates into \u201CI think, therefore I am.\u201D This saying was Descartes revelation. He realized that if he could doubt his existence, then he must exist in some capacity to be able to doubt it. In other words, one cannot doubt that they are doubting. Philosophers apply this reasoning to prove that, in whatever form they may take, conscious, thinking things are _real._ So, Cleo, by using this logic, I have verified that you are a tangible \u201Cthing.\u201D Hence, you can stop worrying, and get back to reading our newest issue.",
